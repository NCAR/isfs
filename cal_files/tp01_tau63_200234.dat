# Results of Steve Oncley's calibrations of TP01 in agar gel,
# before and after PCAPS, Sep 2010 and Apr 2011.

#
# TP01 200234
# Measured Tau63: 1679 (Sep), 1673 (Apr) (0.01 s)
#
# Soil heat diffusivity is a linear function of 1/Tau63:
#   asoil = a.ref * Tau63.ref / Tau63
# Where a.ref=0.14e-6 m^2/s, is diffusifity of agar calibration gel,
# Tau63.ref is the Tau63 measured with the gel.
#
# The nominal Tau63.ref is 19 seconds, but we want to apply the
# measured values from the above calibration. This can be done
# in either of two ways:
# 1. apply the measured value of Tau63.ref for the given TP01 probe in
#    the computation of diffusifity, dat.asoil, in Splus. 
# 2. scale the raw values of Tau63 by a factor in NIDAS before computation of asoil
#
# The first method applies the calibration in one place, which is generally good.
# However the second is easier, and at this point I've elected to do that.
# 
# factor = 19 / (mean of cal Tau63.ref)
#
# DateTime              offset factor
#
