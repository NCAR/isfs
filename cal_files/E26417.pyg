# Calibration factors for Eppy pyrgeometer SN26417
#
#  c(uV/(W/m^2) is cal factor for conversion between thermopile microVolts
#		and W/m^2
#  k(unitless) is B value for dome&case correction.
#  swcor: fraction (%) of shortwave radiation that should be removed
#         from the long wave.  These are usually determined from a shadow
#         test. 999 means unknown.
